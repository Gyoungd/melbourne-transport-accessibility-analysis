### Indicators

#### Stop Density

How close can we access to stops in SA2 (Suburbs)?

**Calculation**

<div style='text-align:center;'>Stop Density = distinct stop count in SA2 / SA2 area (km2)</div><br>


- Assess proximity and convenience for regular commuters
- Identify areas with insufficient stop coverage for safe pedestrian access
- High number of stops $\neq$ High number of travel options
- This indicator means easy accessibility to stops

#### Route Density

How various travel options we have per SA2 (Suburbs)?

**Calculation**

<div style = 'text-align:center;'>Route Density = distinct route count in SA2 / SA2 area (km2)</div><br>


- Identify variety of travle routes/choices for commuters
- Evaluate the potential level of accessibility to other suburbs

#### Service Intensity

How frequent can we use public per SA2 (Suburbs) during weekday?

**Calculation**

<div style = 'text-align:center;'>Service Intensity = Total stop_time_events_weekday / area_km2</div><br>


*stop_time_events_weekday: number of tirp(transportaions visiting) records per stop during weekday (Mon-Fri) based on stop_times table data*

- Give an insight how frequently public transportation come from the point of passenger view
- stop_times = stop-level schedule event
